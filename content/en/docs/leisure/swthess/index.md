## About Startup Weekend

A Techstars Startup Weekend (also known as StartupWeekend or SW) is a 54-hour entrepreneurship educational competitive event, in which groups of participants form teams around ideas the Friday evening, and work during the weekend to develop a working prototype, demo, and VC presentation by Sunday evening.

## Startup Weekend history

Startup Weekend is a hackathon like event started back in 2007 in Boulder, Colorado, USA. As of December 2016, it has reached 135 countries, involving over 210,000 entrepreneurs. Upon its 2015 acquisition from Techstars, Startup Weekend, alongside Startup Week and StartupDigest, became one of the Techstars family of startup programs.

## My role at Startup Weekend
