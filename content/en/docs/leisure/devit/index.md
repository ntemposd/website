## My role at DEVit

DEVit has been organized by a team of 30+ volunteers and powered by SKGTECH NGO, all members were working remotely throughout the year and got together the days before the event for preparing the ground and drink :beers:. Being part of such an exceptional 30 people diverse team for 5 consecutive years is a story worth telling to anyone. Apart from being a Board Member at SKGTECH my work at DEVit included

* Project & Marketing Management
* Financial Operations
* Ticketing Administration
