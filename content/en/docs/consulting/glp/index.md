## About Great Little Place

The Great Little Place (GLP) App has been created with the sole aim of presenting the hidden and less known bars and restaurants around you, or an area you are planning to visit. Great Little Place revealed the best hidden restaurants and bars in 40 cities.

## My Input at GLP

At a point where GLP had accumulated enough Points of Interest in their database, they were searching for their next step; make those data work. I was called to help the GLP team build an algorithm that recommends locations to the App users.

* Recommender Framework Guidelines
* Algorithm Parameters
* Competition Analysis

## Working for GLP

Working for North-London customers while being relaxed in Thessaloniki back in the days when remote wasn't that cool has been an inspiring experience.
