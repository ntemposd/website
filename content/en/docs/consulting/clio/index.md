## Working at Clio

Back in the days Clio was hosted at ACEIN, the incubation center of the Athens University of Economics and Business; the place where our workshops taking place. ACE offers a co-working space packed with students and educational events, it's always cool to be around young entrepreneurs. Thanks to our work, the seed round raised enabled Clio to move in their new Athens Down-Town offices.
