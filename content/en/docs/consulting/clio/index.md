## My role at Clio

I have mainly advised Clio's founding team on the preparation for their Financial Statements during a seed fundraising period. The initial work extended to timely meetings for consulting on various strategic business initiatives.

## Working with Clio

Back in the days, Clio was working at ACEIN, the incubation center of the Athens University of Economics and Business and the space where our workshops took place. ACEIN offers a co-working space packed with students and educational events; it's always great to be around young entrepreneurs. Thanks to our work, the seed round raised enabled Clio to move into their new Athens Down-Town offices.
