## About SXSW

Founded in 1987 in Austin, Texas, SXSW is best known for its conference and festivals that celebrate the convergence of the interactive, film, and music industries. The event, an essential destination for global professionals, features sessions, showcases, screenings, exhibitions, and a variety of networking opportunities. SXSW proves that the most unexpected discoveries happen when diverse topics and people come together.

## My role at SXSW

 I was honored to be a SXSW Accelerator Pitch 2017 Advisory Board Member along with 100+ experienced tech professionals from around the globe. SXSW Pitch is a startup showcase event that has an “open call” for startups to apply. From 2009 to 2021, 572 companies have participated in SXSW Pitch, with over 82% receiving funding and acquisitions in excess of $14.5 billion.

* Reviewed Startup Applications for the Fintech & Big-Data tracks
* Startup Recruiting in Greece & Cyprus

## Life at SXSW

Visiting the actual event as an Advisory Board Member was eventually left in my backlog, and is yet there for the future.
