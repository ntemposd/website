## Life at wappier

This has been a Remote role from day one. With the whole team being traditionally at the office, I have been the first remote team member. Well, not for long! The most exciting story to unfold here, is how a fast-growing organization transitioned from Office to Remote in a week or two. One thing I am definitely still missing is traveling to attend team gatherings in Athens, Greece. I sadly couldn't manage to do that post-Pandemic.
