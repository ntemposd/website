## About Codebender

Codebender is the easiest, most advanced Arduino IDE for hobbyists, educators, and professionals. Write code easily in a great code editor, find bugs faster with the improved error output, and get inspiration by searching in the 350,000+ Arduino sketches on the platform.

## My role at Codebender

Throughout my time at Codebender we've tried to launch a spin-off product for K12 children STEM teachers. The Playboard Project was an educational approach comprised of an Arduino powered Printed Circuit Board with built in sensors, a drag and drop Scratch like user interface, and a series of tinkering tutorials.

* Crowdfunding Financial Analysis and Campaign Preparation
* Customer & User Research (Educator Interviews, K12 Workshops)
* Product Design
* Key Account Management

## Life at Codebender

One of the coolest places I have worked at. Back in the days Codebender's team was hosted at P-Space, the Patras hackerspace for makers, and the place where the idea of Codebender was born. I moved in Patras, Greece to join them and work from the comfort of Codebender's sofa.
